- This is a human-labelled training dataset which consists of author IDX, PMID, first author last name, and first author initial. 
- The dataset contains 2,875 publications authored by 385 real authors with 431 name variants.

[2] AND_1000_MATCHES.txt.
- This file includes SCOPUS author ids that matched a PMID from SCOPUS database (http://www.scopus.com/).
- The first column is a SCOPUS id, the second is a PMID, and the last is the author name of PMID.
